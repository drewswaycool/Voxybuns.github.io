<p>Hello! My nameâ€™s Voxy. Iâ€™m a hobbyist graphic and web designer from Belgium, and this is my very own blog dedicated to <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/game-builder-garage-switch/">Game Builder Garage</a> by Nintendo!</p>

<p>I grew up playing WarioWare D.I.Y., and I always wanted to capture the same feeling I had back then, creating fun little games and sharing them with others. With the announcement of Game Builder Garage, it seems like this could finally happen, almost a decade later! Before that, I spent a lot of time on Nintendo Labo VR Kit, which already had a near-identical game creation tool. Lots of people made really cool stuff in it, myself included, so naturally, Game Builder Garage was a rather obvious purchase, especially since, unlike Labo, Iâ€™ll actually be able to share my games with other people!</p>

<p>I wanted to have a place where I could be free to talk about said games, but also help people making their own, by sharing some programming knowledge, or resources anyone would be free to use in their creations. I wanted a space to talk about something Iâ€™m passionate about, soâ€¦ Here it is!</p>

<p>This is my first time making and trying to maintain a blog. I have no schedule, no experience, and absolutely no idea of what Iâ€™m doing, but I think Iâ€™m gonna have a lot of fun, and I hope youâ€™ll tag along for the ride!</p>

<p>â€” Voxy</p>
