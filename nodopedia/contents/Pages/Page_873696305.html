<p>Game Builder Garage uses the x, y, and z axes to refer to direction, position, and rotation.<br />All three axes meet each other at right angles.<br /></p>

<h1 id="Anchor_873696305_h1_1">Referring to Direction</h1>
<p>If the x-axis is running left and right, then the y-axis will run up and down, and the z-axis back and forth.<br />Right will be X+, left will be X-.<br />Up will be Y+, down will be Y-.<br />Forward will be Z+, backward will be Z-.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_873696305_h1_2">Referring to Position</h1>
<p>The point where all three axes intersect will be position 0 for each axis.<br />Positions lower than 0 will be represented with a minus value.<br />The unit of measurement is meters (m).<br />For example, the position of a point that is 10 meters away from 0 in the X- direction would be referred to as -10m.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_873696305_h1_3">Referring to Rotation</h1>
<p>Looking from the 0 position in the X+ direction, counterclockwise rotation is referred to as X+ rotation.<br />Looking from the 0 position in the Y+ direction, counterclockwise rotation is referred to as Y+ rotation.<br />Looking from the 0 position in the Z+ direction, counterclockwise rotation is referred to as Z+ rotation.<br />The unit of measurement is degrees.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_873696305_h1_4">World Coordinates</h1>
<p>The game's space and world within it will always face in the same direction.<br />When the game is initialized, before any Nodon are called, X+ will be right, Y+ will be up, and Z+ will be forward on the game screen.<br />This coordinate system, which is based on the positioning and direction of the world, is referred to as the "world coordinates" system.<br /></p>
<h1 id="Anchor_873696305_h1_5">Local Coordinates</h1>
<p>Objects rotate independently on their own axes. When rotated, the axes themselves will rotate along with the object.<br />If the object moves independently, its coordinate position will remain at zero.<br />This coordinate system, which is based on the positioning and direction of an individual object, is referred to as the "local coordinate" system.<br />When an Object Nodon is called, before any of its settings have been altered, its local coordinates will be the same as the world coordinates.<br />Connection points and texture faces will be referred to with the object's local coordinates.<br />For example, the face of a Person Nodon will always face toward the Z- direction of the local coordinates. This will never change, no matter what direction the Person moves or rotates in.<br /></p>
<h1 id="Anchor_873696305_h1_6">Camera Coordinates</h1>
<p>The camera, which captures the game space, can move independently of the world and the objects within it.<br />Moving or rotating the camera will not change what can be viewed from it.<br />This coordinate system, which is based on the positioning and direction of the camera, is referred to as the "camera coordinate" system.<br />In relation to the console screen or monitor, right is X+, up is Y+, and forward is Z+.</p>
