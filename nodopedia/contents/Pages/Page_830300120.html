<p>Sets how closely the horizontal movement of the connected object, or the position represented by input received, will be tracked. If it's set to 0.00, it won't follow at all. If it's set to 1.00, it'll move immediately to the target.<br />Can be set to between 0.00 and 1.00.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_830300120_h2_5">Vertical Tracking Rate</h2>
<p>Sets how closely the vertical movement of the connected object, or the position represented by input received, will be tracked. If it's set to 0.00, it won't follow at all. If it's set to 1.00, it'll move immediately to the target.<br />Can be set to between 0.00 and 1.00.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_830300120_h2_6">Camera Field of View</h2>
<p>Sets the horizontal angle of the area framed by the camera.<br />Can be between 10.00 and 120.00. Measured in degrees (°).</p>
