Measured in meters.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_830288757_h2_15">Position</h2>

<h2 id="Anchor_830288757_h2_16">Rotation</h2>
<p>Sets the direction of the launch origin when the game is initialized or reset.<br />The X, Y, and Z axes can each be set to between -180.00° and 180.00°.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_830288757_h1_3">Other</h1>
<p>When the Launch-Object Nodon is embedded into an object-generating Nodon, the object and the launched objects won't be able to collide until after they've separated completely for the first time.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_830288757_h2_17">Three Types of Launch-Object Nodon</h2>
<p>Launch-Object Nodon can be divided into three different types depending on the limit on the number of objects they can have launched at once.<br />The launch limits are as follows:<br />・Launch-Object Nodon (1 object) can launch 1 object per Nodon.<br />・Launch-Object Nodon (10 objects) can launch 10 objects per Nodon.<br />・Launch-Object Nodon (100 objects) can launch 100 objects per Nodon.<br />When an object is launched that exceeds the limit, the oldest launched object will be deleted.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_830288757_h2_18">Call Limit</h2>
<p>You can call up to a certain number of Launch-Object Nodon per game. The upper limit varies depending on how many objects they can launch:<br />・64 Launch-Object Nodon (1 object)<br />・16 Launch-Object Nodon (10 objects)<br />・2 Launch-Object Nodon (100 objects)</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_830288757_h3_1">Special Costs</h3>
<p>All object-generating Nodon impose a "cost," and the cost limit per game is 512.<br />Note that this cost is separate from the overall 512 Nodon limit.<br />Object-related Nodon other than the Launch-Object Nodon have a cost of 1.<br />Launch-Object Nodon costs are calculated differently, as shown below.<br /><br />・Launch-Object Nodon (1 object) impose a cost of 3 per Nodon.<br />・Launch-Object Nodon (10 objects) impose a cost of 12 per Nodon.<br />・Launch-Object Nodon (100 objects) impose a cost of 102 per Nodon.<br /></p>
