(In practice, the value is determined by how the input Nodon gives\nits output.)\nThe two settings should be considered a set.\nOutput\nSpecifies either Digital or Analog.\nIf it's set to Digital, an output value of 1.00 will be sent if the input is within the values specified in Range. If it's outside the range, it'll send 0.00.\nIf it's set to Analog, values lower than the range's lower limit will be sent as 0.00, and values within it will be converted precisely to a value between 0.00 and 1.00. If it's higher than the range's upper limit, it'll be sent as 1.00.\nRange Slider\nUpper/Lower Handle\nThe two handles can be moved left or right.\nThe raw input value (for example, the amount that a control stick is tilted) is converted according to the graph shown above the slider and then sent as output.\nThe horizontal axis represents the input, and the vertical axis represents the output.\nValue Preview\nThe arrow underneath the slider shows a preview of the value.\nIt moves left or right, depending on the raw input value.\nThe value that will be sent from the Nodon is shown in the square part of the mark.\n \tOutput \t0.00 \t0.50 \t1.00\n \tDisplay \t\n \t\n \t\n Common Settings\nInput Threshold and Analog Output\nThis refers to analog ranges with a small deadzone—for example, 0.10 to 1.00.\nInput values lower than 0.10 will be output as 0.00, so very small input will be disregarded. We can call 0.10 the \"input threshold.\"\nIf the input exceeds 0.10, it'll start to output, and the output will increase along with the input. If 1.00 is received as input, it'll send 1.00 as output.\nWhen called up, most input Nodon will have their ranges set like this by default. (Some Nodon may have different input thresholds for the lower margin.)\nA Nodon like the Shake Nodon can pick up slight movement even when the player is trying to hold the Joy-Con still, so having an input threshold can ensure that output is sent only when the Joy-Con is intentionally shaken.\nSensitive Analog Output\nSettings similar to an analog range of 0.00 to 0.50.\nResponds sensitively to input. Any input above a certain value will result in an output of 1.00.\nIn the example above, an input of 0.50 will result in an output of 1.00, which represents a sensitivity double that of a range like 0.00 to 1.00.\nYou can adjust the sensitivity by moving the slider on the right.\nSending Raw Values as Analog Output\nSettings similar to an analog range of 0.00 to 1.00.\nWith a range of 0.00 to 1.00, the value received as input will be sent unchanged as output.\nIf-Style Digital Handling\nSettings similar to a digital range of 0.10 to 1.00.\nUse this when you want to make a clear, digital judgment of a momentary occurrence—for example, the swinging of a Joy-Con.\nVery small input won't produce any response (it'll continue to output 0.00), but if it goes over the threshold, it'll output 1.00. It won't output intermediate values like 0.50.\nYou can adjust the handle for the lower margin to change the input threshold.\nWhile-Style Digital Handling\nSettings similar to a digital range of 0.50 to 0.60.\nOutputs 1.00 under specific input conditions. Outside of those conditions,\noutputs 0.00.\nFor example, you might use this type of setting if you wanted to use the If-Face-Up Nodon to check whether the Joy-Con is held at a certain angle.\n",0,""],["Pages/Page_800003318.html","Comparison Nodon","\t\t\nComparison Nodon\n I compare two numbers according to the conditions you give me.\nBut what will they beeee?\nPort\nInput\n \tPort name \tPort function \tInput operation\n \tInput 1 \tThe value received at this port is used as the first number in the comparison. \tSignal passes through unchanged\n \tInput 2 \tThe value received at this port is used as the second number in the comparison. \tSignal passes through unchanged\n Output\n \tPort name \tPort function \tOutput value\n \tResult \tCompares input 1 and input 2 according to the specified conditions, then outputs 1.00 if the condition is met. \t0.00 or 1.00\n Connection\nNone\nSettings\nComparison Method\nSpecifies how to compare the two input values.\n \tSetting value \tDescription\n \t= \tOutputs 1.00 when input 1 and input 2 have the same value.\nIf they aren't the same, the output will be 0.00.\n \t> \tOutputs 1.00 when input 1 is greater than input 2.\nIf it isn't greater, the output will be 0.00.\n \t< \tOutputs 1.00 when input 1 is less than input 2.\nIf it isn't less, the output will be 0.00.\n \t≥ \tOutputs 1.00 when input 1 is greater than or equal to input 2.\nIf it isn't greater or equal, the output will be 0.00.\n \t≤ \tOutputs 1.00 when input 1 is less than or equal to input 2.\nIf it isn't less or equal, the output will be 0.00.\n",0,""],["Pages/Page_800003430.html","Effect Nodon","\t\t\nEffect Nodon\n Here I am...here to make\na ton of fancy effects!\nPort\nInput\n \tPort name \tPort function \tInput operation\n \tTrigger \t When a value other than 0.00 is received at this port, the specified effect will be displayed.\n \tDetermines whether a signal is or is not equal to 0.00\n Output\nNone\nConnection\n \tPort name \tPort function\n \tLower connection port \t This is a special type of port that physically links objects generated by Nodon on the game screen.

This will never change, no matter what direction the Person moves or rotates in.\n\nCamera Coordinates\nThe camera, which captures the game space, can move independently of the world and the objects within it.\nMoving or rotating the camera will not change what can be viewed from it.\nThis coordinate system, which is based on the positioning and direction of the camera, is referred to as the "camera coordinate" system.\nIn relation to the console screen or monitor, right is X+, up is Y+, and forward is Z+.\n',0,""],["Pages/Page_873697879.html","Connection Point: Auto","\t\t\nConnection Point: Auto\nAbout Automatic Connection Points\nIf Connection Point is set to Auto, objects will be connected via the faces that are closest to each other.\nIf the objects are overlapping, it'll take the position into account as well.\nWhen Objects Are Connected via Connector Nodon\nWhen two objects are connected via connector Nodon such as the Slide-Connector Nodon, the Free-Slide-Connector Nodon, the Hinge-Connector Nodon, or the String-Connector Nodon, the connection point will be determined from the location of the connector Nodon.\n",0,""],["Pages/Page_873705541.html","Controls","\t\t\nControls\nSwitching between Control Methods\nYou can control Game Builder Garage with the following methods:\n \tTouch Controls\n \tControl Stick Pointer\n \tMotion-Control Pointer\n \tMouse\nIn the pause menu's control settings, you can configure settings for both TV mode controls and handheld/tabletop mode controls.\nIf a USB mouse is connected, the game will switch to mouse controls automatically.\nGeneral Controls\n\nPress  on the Joy-Con controller to switch between the game screen and the program screen.\n\nPress  on the Joy-Con controller to pause.\nOn the pause menu, you can quit the game or lesson, configure controls, read through the log, or check the Nodopedia.\nHold Down \nHold down  on the Joy-Con controller while on the game screen to trigger a retry.\nPress  or  on the Game Screen\nIf the If-Touched Nodon or Touch-Position Nodon are called, then pressing  or  on the game screen will activate the motion-control pointer.
